# Aura
A capstone project: Aura provides live, crowd-sourced updates by allowing people at a location to share real-time insights on its energy, noise level, and crowd type. Users contribute quick, structured check-ins — no long reviews — so others can instantly see the current atmosphere and find a space that matches their vibe.
